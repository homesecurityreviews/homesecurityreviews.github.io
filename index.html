    <p>My name is Mark Smith, and I’m a co-founder of <a href="/">HomeSecurity.Reviews</a>.</p>
    <p>This site is a labor of love and something I care very much about. I hope you’ll get tremendous value from the information we'll provide, and that you’ll see our passion in every page that is soon to launch.</p>
    <p>I am a veteran of the industry. I oversaw the sales of more than 250,000 home security systems at Pinnacle Security, Devcon Security, and Frontpoint. I was also part of the Vivint family, and have consulted with half a dozen other security firms.</p>
    <p>Still, one thing never sat right — while each of those companies offered a terrific product and value, none of them were the right fit for every American family. Yet it was difficult for me to refer someone to a competitor.</p>
    <p>So, even though I feel great that I always provided a great product, maybe it wasn’t always the <em>perfect</em> fit.</p>
    <p>That’s why I'm starting this website. The fact is, no single home security company offers a perfect fit for every household. So, we're building this site to help families make the right choices for them.</p>
    <p>Maybe you love technology and won’t settle for anything but the most cutting edge smart home service. Well, <a href="https://www.vivint.com/" rel=”nofollow”>Vivint</a> is probably the right fit for you.</p>
    <p>Maybe you are a renter and need the flexibility to move your system with you. Well, let’s set you up with <a href="https://simplisafe.com/" rel=”nofollow”>Simplisafe</a>.</p>
    <p>What if you want a professional installation and impeccable customer service? You can’t go wrong with <a href="https://www.adt.com/" rel=”nofollow”>ADT</a>, especially with Tim Whall in charge.</p>
    <p>Or, maybe you want the same amazing customer service but want to save a little money. Perfect. <a href="https://www.frontpointsecurity.com/" rel=”nofollow”>Frontpoint</a> is the one for you.</p>
    <p>We have spent countless hours researching each of these companies. Really. For you to find the same information on your own you’d need to spend over 200 hours doing research. Wouldn’t you rather be taking a nice walk with your family instead?</p>
    <p>We know what they excel at — we know what they could do better. We’ve met personally with their leadership and can comfortably say they embody the values that you can trust.</p>
    <p>More than anything, we want you to be happy and safe. We believe in the value of home security and know that if you can find the right fit for you, your family will be safer than ever. If you go through this site and still can’t make a decision, give us a call and we’ll walk you through all of your questions.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Thank you again for visiting our site. It means the world to us.</p>
